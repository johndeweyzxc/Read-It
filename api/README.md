## How to run the API

On your terminal do "npm start", it uses nodemon so everytime you create and save changes the server will automatically be restarted for you. In the server.js file on line 33, do not forget to change the value of IP to the IP address of your computer in your local network. By default the API listens at the specified local IP and localhost at PORT 3000.
